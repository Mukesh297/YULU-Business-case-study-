Yulu case study (hypothesis testing)
## **YULU Background**

> Yulu is Indiaâ€™s leading micro-mobility service provider, which offers unique vehicles for the daily commute. Starting off as a mission to eliminate traffic congestion in India, Yulu provides the safest commute solution through a user-friendly mobile app to enable shared, solo and sustainable commuting.

> Yulu zones are located at all the appropriate locations (including metro stations, bus stands, office spaces, residential areas, corporate offices, etc) to make those first and last miles smooth, affordable, and convenient!

## **Buisness Goal of case study**:

> Yulu has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared electric cycles depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared electric cycles in the Indian market.

### So Basically YULU wants to know:


*   Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market?
*  How well those variables describe the electric cycle demands.

### Concepts Used as:

1.   Bi-variate Analysis
2.   2-sample t-test:testing for difference across populations.
3.   ANNOVA TEST
4.   Chi-Squared Test

## Recommendations:
1.   As no of Rides are declining during the adverse weather condition YULU should make some Refreshing stalls at Pick up and drop station and in between station.
2.   Yulu can reduce the rate/price when the weather or season is not favourable.
3.   Yulu can provide exiciting offers during office hours on workdays so that people try to use bicycles instead of buses/cars.

4.  On holidays, discounts can be offered for multiple bicycle bookings by one account as usually friends and family groups plan to go out and if discount is offered it might attract them.

5. Yulu should do social media Campaigning to advertise itself as Environment safe company and try to lure people towards environment protection.
